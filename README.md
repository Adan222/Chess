# Java Chess

A fully functional Chess game built using Java and Swing for a university project. The game features a classic 2-player interface with core chess rules implemented, including piece movement, capturing, turn-based play, check, and checkmate detection. The UI is developed with Java Swing to provide an interactive and intuitive experience.

To simplify building and running, a `Makefile` is provided.

To build and run the game, use:

```bash
make build && make run
# or simply
make all
```
